# js-timeline
javascript translation of https://github.com/jasonreisman/Timeline. (Forked: formated and slightly documented https://github.com/Linkviii/Timeline) Currently broken. `simple_timeline_ref.svg` generated from original python using `simple_timeline.json`. Renders right in chrome but not firefox.
